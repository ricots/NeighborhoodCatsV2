# Project 4 Research
## "Baking Mad" (Working title): A recipe app for Android


### Research Plan
 1. Title - "Filling the gap in Android recipe apps"
 2. Authors and stakeholders - Rob Errera (roberterrera@gmail.com)
 3. Date - 3/17/16
 4. Background - Recipe sites are a popular way that people find new recipes to cook, and while there are some recipe apps on Android, the few that are available do not sufficiently meet the needs of their target demographic, and are often buggy as well.
 5. Goals - To provide a
 6. Research questions -
  1. Where do you currently find new recipes?
  2. Which recipe apps have you used on your phone or tablet?
  3. Out of the apps you've used, what have you liked about them?
  4. Out of the apps you've used, what have you disliked about them?
  5. How often do you (or do you think you would) share a recipe from an app?
  6. To where, specifically, would you share a recipe?
  7. On a scale from 1-10, how useful (10 being the most useful) would the ability to search for a recipe based on ingredients in your fridge be?
 7. Methodology - Potential users will be interviewed over the course of one week, and the results will shape the priority of features of the app.
 8. Participants - The target persona is "Anna", a full-time editor who is married and has a long commute to and from work every day. She loves to cook, but finds it exhausting to come up with new recipes each week, and finds it boring to eat the same thing over and over again. She's tried many recipe apps but has not found one that contains all the features needed to make that recipe app truly useful.
 9. Schedule - Participant recruiting starts: 3/14/16; the study begins 3/16/16; expected results: 3/19/16.
 10. Script -
     1. Priority features
     - What are the most requested features for a recipe app?
     2. Sharing
     - How important is the ability to share a recipe?
     3. Timeline
     - Would re-envisioning a recipe on a timeline be useful to most users? How could it work in code?
     4. Focus
     - Would the app be most affective if focused on only baking? Or is a broader range of topics better?
     5. UX
     - What base level of gestures and visual style is expected by the user?


### User Stories
 1. The user can access a database of recipes sourced from more than one reputable site.
 2. The user has the ability to search through recipes and filter them.
 3. The user can save recipes (with offline access).
 4. The user can rate recipes and comment on them.
 5. The user can speak aloud and ask the app to read a specific step back.
 6. The user can see a timeline for each recipe that shows the timing of each portion of the recipe.

### Problem Statement
Anna needs a way to find new recipes via her phone because she likes to plan meals ahead of being home, and current Android recipe apps are not sufficient.


### Prioritized Features
 1. Ability to search through and filter recipes from a database of recipes from a variety of reputable sources.
 2. A way to save recipes in an organized way and make them available for offline viewing (often called a "recipe box").
 3. Allows the user to rate a recipe.
 4. Allows the user to search for recipes based on ingredients they currently have.
 5. Allows the user to comment on a recipe.
