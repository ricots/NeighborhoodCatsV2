 - What are your overall objectives for the project? What problem(s) are you solving? What user goals are you making possible?
     My objectives are to build an app that allows the user to search through recipes from various sources, and add recipes to their own collection.
 - What is/are the main takeaways from your research findings? Briefly recap what you learned.
     My research shows that of the few Android recipe apps that exist, they each lack something the target demographic wants from that type of app: either there are no saved recipes, the app is laggy/buggy, the number of recipes are limited, search is too limited, or they include frustrating UX/UI features.
 - Who is your target audience?
     People who cook fairly often and plan their meals on the go.
 - What features will you include? They should map to your user goals. Make sure you offer a coherent rationale for why they were chosen.
     1. The ability to search the Yummly API database and filter by a variety of criteria.
     2. The ability to add recipes to a user's collection.
     3. The ability to search through the user's collection.
     4. The ability to rate and comment on a recipe so other users know whether it's worth the effort or needs adjustments.
     5. The ability to view a timeline that visually shows how each part of a recipe should be timed (this may not make v1,0).
 - How will this differentiate from your competitors? What pain points are being addressed?
     Some competitors are buggy or laggy, some do not have a recipe box to save recipes to, some do not allow you to search your recipe box, and some have a frustrating UX.
 - Are there any constraints you have to work with? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)
     I am working with a time constraint of ~2.5 weeks, the platform is limited to Android, and there are legal guidelines to the Yummly API that must be studied. A more open API may be necessary unless this app can be deemed as not a competitor to the core Yummly app.
 - Is there anything else you think might help us (your stakeholders) understand what youâ€™re proposing?
     A clean, intuitive recipe app on Android would be largely popular because there is a large gap in available products within that market.
